# Comparative Analysis of Concurrency Models in Java, Erlang and Python
## The One Billion Row Challenge

### Abstract:
This thesis proposes a comprehensive comparative analysis of concurrency models in three different programming languages: Java, Erlang, and Python. The study will use the billion row challenge as a benchmarking platform to assess the concurrency capabilities of each language in handling and processing massive datasets. By examining performance metrics such as throughput, latency, and resource utilization, the thesis aims to provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of concurrency mechanisms employed by each language. Additionally, the research will explore practical implications for real-world applications requiring efficient processing of large-scale data.
## Introduction:
Concurrency is a fundamental aspect of modern software development, particularly in contexts where scalability and performance are of importance. Java, Erlang, and Python represent three distinct paradigms in terms of concurrency models: thread-based concurrency in Java, lightweight actor-based concurrency in Erlang, and a mix of thread-based and asynchronous programming in Python. Despite their differences, each language offers solutions for concurrent programming, making them suitable candidates for comparison.
## Objective:
The primary objective of this thesis is to evaluate and compare the concurrency models of Java, Erlang, and Python using the billion row challenge as a standardized benchmark. By measuring the performance of concurrent data parsing, processing and presenting across these languages, the thesis aims to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each language. 

## Methodology:
The research will involve designing and implementing concurrent data processing algorithms in Java, Erlang, and Python to address the billion row challenge. Each implementation will be optimized for performance and scalability while adhering to the idiomatic concurrency patterns of the respective languages. Performance metrics such as throughput, latency, and resource consumption will be measured and analyzed using standardized testing methodologies. The thesis will divide the task into three different stages, data parsing, processing and presenting. The first step will be to identify the most effective parsing of the dataset, the second will be how to process it and finally how to present it. 
## Expected Outcomes:
- Quantitative comparison of concurrency performance across Java, Erlang, and Python.
- Identification of strengths and weaknesses in concurrency models of each language.
- Insights into practical considerations for selecting the appropriate language for concurrent data processing tasks.
- Recommendations for optimizing concurrency performance in each language based on the findings.
